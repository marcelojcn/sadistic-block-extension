# Extension

This is a sadistic or rather masochist version of a focus extension.
It simple, yet rather annoying. Because, while it is easy to insert new urls to the block, it is however, hard to remove them from the blocked urls.

# How to User

2. Go to `chrome://extensions`;

# Possible future implementations

## 1.2. Removal
Add a removal button for the blocked urls. However, user needs to wait 1 month before being able to click on it.
